# CPL

CPL stands for **C**ompetitive **P**rogramming **L**ibrary.

The main purpose of this project is to properly maintain various implementations of algorithms and data structures (mostly for personal competitive programming purposes, for now).

I take this project as a learning experience of creating & maintaining a C++ header library with CMake, googletest and Github actions.
